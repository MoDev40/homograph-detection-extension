# Homograph Attack Detector

**Protect yourself from deceptive websites with real-time homograph attack detection.**

## ⚠️ What is a Homograph Attack?

A **homograph attack** is a deceptive technique where attackers register websites with visually similar domain names to legitimate ones. These domains exploit similarities between characters (e.g., using `аmаzon.com` with Cyrillic letters) to trick users into thinking they’re visiting a trusted site.

Example:
`https://www.amɑzon.com` (with fake characters)
instead of
`https://www.amazon.com`

Victims may unknowingly provide passwords, credit card details, or other sensitive information to attackers.
